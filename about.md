# About

Hi, I am Hrushikesh Kachgunde, I am a self taught programmer currently deep diving into the concepts of Macnine Learning. I write blogs to keep track on my projects and also to share my knowledge to all the beginners who are just getting started. This not only helps the beginners but also me, since, I get more knowledgeable once I write things out to explain them to somebody.

Currently the topic I am studying is ANNs for Deep Learning. I believe in project based learning as well as conceptual knowledge gaining. I try to understand the things from root and I would suggest the same to all my readers.

Once I finish learning about all the important topics in the Deep Learning, I would dig deeper into TensorFlow, you will get all the updates in the future blogs.

My blogs on Hashnode - [Heights For AI](https://heightsforai.hashnode.dev/) <br>
I also own an e-commerce store which sells custom print designs on hoodies, T-shirts and all kinds of accesories - [Black Cloud Store](https://blackcloudstoreaura.company.site/)
