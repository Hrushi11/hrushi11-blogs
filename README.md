# Hrushi's Blog

I write all my blogs under two domains one under hashnode and the other under github.io.

My blogs are not only available for learning but also to share your knowledge with others. 

To share your knowledge :
> Clone this repo and add your blog into suitable format in the `_posts` section, <br>
> then put a PR (Pull Request), then, <br>
> if your blog is legit, I will accept your PR and post your blog with suitalble credits to you.

You might find some extra content on `github.io` one because they might have been collaborated with some other person.
