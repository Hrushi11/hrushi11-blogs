Hello and welcome to this blog, I am glad you reached here. I am a learner and currently I am deep diving into some of the conceptual topics Of Deep Learning in Machine Learning. I believe in project based learning so, you would find that most of my blogs will revolve around some project or a real world example to understand the topic in more depth.

I have started a series of blogs on Neural networks and currently I am focussing on it. In this series I will try to make understand the beginners about importance of Neural networks and make them understand the conceptual aspects of the same.

Hope you would love my blogs.
